# Synchronous Interprocess Messaging Project for LINUX (SIMPL)

SIMPL was a free and open-source project that allows QNX-style synchronous message passing by adding a Linux library
using user space techniques like shared memory and Unix pipes[3] to implement SendMssg/ReceiveMssg/ReplyMssg inter-process
messaging mechanisms, [as documented in its Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMPL).

This repository is a historyless archive of [the projects Sourceforge CVS repository](http://sourceforge.net/projects/simpl/)
for historical archival purposes (just in case Sourceforge terminates their CVS access and/or CVS software clients becomes unavailable).

This archive is intended to allow future generates to study old code, to understand why it was bad and how we are doing
so much better today. It is **not intended** to be actually used by anyone for any reason.
