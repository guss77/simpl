This code is released as open source.   We hope you find 
it useful.  If you discover a bug or add an enhancement 
contact us on the SIMPL project mailing list. 

-------------------------

These examples are intended to be illustrative.   They are, however,
quite able to form the basis of some full applications.

Each examples directory contains the following subdirectories:
	src  - where the Makefile, .c and readme instructions live
	include - where all the .h headers for that example live

==============================================
The following examples are currently provided:
==============================================
logmasker - demonstrates the run time masking abilities of SIMPL
	    trace logger ($SIMPL_HOME/fclogger)
tclReceiver - demonstrates the ability to exchange SIMPL style messages
            between a Linux app and a Tcl script.
rtInterface - demonstrates the exchange of messages with an RTLinux module
tclet - demonstrates the ability to exchange SIMPL style messages
	between a Linux app and a Tcl/Tk applet.
tclet2 - demonstrates the ability to make a Tcl/Tk applet into a
	SIMPL sender
tclet3 - demonstrates the ability to write RPC style code from
	a Tcl/Tk applet using SIMPL messaging as the carrier
java2simpl - demonstrates the tclet style exchange of messages between
	SIMPL app and a JAVA thread.
python - demonstrates the SIMPL Python language hooks
fcnet - network failure reporting program

This list will hopefully expand as we collect more useful examples.

Contributions from outside are welcome.
