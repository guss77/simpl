This program is an example to prove that Java will work with the
SIMPL project.  It is not the cleanest of code, so you will have
to forgive me for the style.  It was written as a learning tool.
I have never used Java before, so I figured this was a little
better than creating the standard "Hello World" app.

COMPILING:

cd $SIMPL_HOME/examples/java2simpl/src
make
make install

NOTE: this assumes that you have installed the JDK 1.2 for
      Linux

EXECUTING:

To begin, you will need to open at least 3 console windows:

1 - used to tail the logfile
2 - to execute tclet2 example go script
3 - to execute the java app (NetTest)

Window 1:
cd $SIMPL_HOME/bin
tail -f junk

Window 2:
cd $SIMPL_HOME/examples/tclet2/src
go

Window 3:
cd $SIMPL_HOME/examples/bin
java NetTest

Once the GUI begins, enter the following:

Host should be left as localhost
Port should be left as 16415

press "Call" Button  // this will connect to SIMPL

type "LOCATE" in message window (beside "Send" button)
press "Send" Button  // return key not implemented yet

type "ATTACH" in message window
press "Send" Button

type a message in message window (ie This is going to work...)
press "Send" Button

you should receive "hello there_0"

NOTE: - every message you send should be replied with a "hello there_#"
      - each # will be higher than the last one

NOTE: - you can clear the receive window by pressing the "Clear" 
        button and view what every you receive in either hex or 
        text
      - select the radio button that you would like to view

when finished
type "DETACH" in message window
press "Send" Button


That's it.  Have fun.  If you have any comments or questions, my
e-mail is below.  Remember, this was only a learning exercise, so
go easy on me.

P.S. You will notice that some of the characters may not fit within
     the buttons.  This gui was first developed on a NT platform and
     then used here.  I have not actually sat down to try and figure
     out how to correct this problem.  I know it has to do with fonts
     defined in a config file somewhere.
