=======================================
How to build the tclReceiver example.
=======================================
This makes the assumption that you have already downloaded and
installed the latest SIMPL code.  It also makes the assumption
that you have tcl8.0 or better installed on your machine.

1) undo the SIMPL examples tarball at one directory ABOVE
$FC_HOME. ie:
	cd $FC_HOME
	cd ..
	tar -xvf <tarballname>

2) build the tclReceiver executables
	cd $FC_HOME/examples/tclReceiver/src
	make clobber
	make install

This will place two executables in $FC_HOME/examples/bin
	$FC_HOME/examples/bin/tclReceiver.tcl
	$FC_HOME/examples/bin/tclStim

"tclReceiver.tcl" will be the be the receiver of messages from "tclStim".
These messages will demonstate Send/Receive/Reply messaging between a
Linux app and a stand alone Tcl script.

===================================
How to run the tclReceiver example
===================================
For this you will need to open 3 consoles (or Xterm windows).

on Console 1: logged into $FC_HOME/bin

	fclogger -n LOGGER   
	(or fclogger -n LOGGER > junk   to redirect trace log to a file)
	where
		LOGGER - name given to the trace logger process

on Console 2: logged into $FC_HOME/examples/bin

	tclReceiver.tcl -N BOBTCL -m 0xff -l LOGGER
	where
		BOBTCL - name given to the "tclReceiver.tcl" process
		0xff - command line log mask override
		LOGGER - name of trace logger in step 1 above

on console 3: logged into $FC_HOME/examples/bin

	tclStim -n BOBS -r BOBTCL -l LOGGER
	where
		BOBS - name given to the tclStim process
		BOBTCL - name of recipient (the "tclReceiver.tcl" on console 2)
		LOGGER - name of trace logger

The "tclStim" (Stim stands for stimulator) should prompt for a command with:
	Enter command:
for a list of possible commands you can enter ?

To run this little example type each of the follow commands in sequence
and examine the output of the trace logger on console 1 BETWEEN each.

	Enter command: t hi
	Enter command: t hello everybody
	Enter command: q

What we are doing is causing a FC_TESTING_MSG to be sent from 
"tclStim" -> "tclReceiver.tcl".  This message will then be displayed 
on console 2 screen and placed in the trace log.

The source for the tclReceiver.tcl is arrived at by cat'g all the 
.tcl files in (the make command does this)
	$FC_HOME/examples/tclReceiver/src/ 

Have fun.

We have used a similar scheme to form the basis of some very powerful
Tcl/Tk applications.   It is very straightforward to extend this example
to a GUI type application using Tk.
