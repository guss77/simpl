=======================================
How to build the tclet example.
=======================================
This makes the assumption that you have already downloaded and
installed the latest SIMPL code.  It also makes the assumption
that you have tcl8.0 or better installed on your machine.

1) undo the SIMPL examples tarball at one directory ABOVE
$FC_HOME. ie:
	cd $FC_HOME
	cd ..
	tar -xvf <tarballname>

2) build the tclet executables
	cd $FC_HOME/examples/tclet2/src
	make clobber
	make install

This will place two files in $FC_HOME/examples/bin
	$FC_HOME/examples/bin/fc2.html
	$FC_HOME/examples/bin/fc2.tcl

"fc2.tcl" is the applet code and fc2.html is the web page which embeds the
applet.

===================================
How to run the tclet example
===================================
Note: an assumption is made that you have downloaded and installed
TclPlugin v2.0 or better.   The assumption is also made that you have
installed the fcsocket.tcl package in the TclPlugin directory as per
the 
	$FC_HOME/tcl/src/readme

For this you will need to open 2 consoles (or Xterm windows).

on Console 1: logged into $FC_HOME/examples/tclet2/src

	go

using the browser retrieve the fc2.html file above.   This should cause the 
tclet (fc2.tcl) to render.   At this point the applet has been installed
as a normal SIMPL enabled "sender".

From within the applet we need to do a name locate on the SIMPL receiver
to which we wish to send our messages.   The "go" script above assigned the
SIMPL name
	BOBR
to the receiver (called fifoReceiver).  You therefore need to enter BOBR into
the message box next to the locate button.  You then need to press the "locate"
button to force the name locate to occur.

If this step is successful the sendMe button will then be enabled.  At this 
point you can enter our message into the message box and hit "sendMe".  You 
should see a reply appear in the message box below your message.  You can
repeat this send as many times as you wish.

Have fun.
