===================================
How to build the rtInterface example.
===================================
This makes the assumption that you have already downloaded and
installed the SIMPL code.  

It also makes the assumption that you have downloaded the RTLinux 1.1
and installed it.

1) undo the SIMPL examples tarball at one directory ABOVE
$FC_HOME. ie:
	cd $FC_HOME
	cd ..
	tar -xvf <tarballname>

2) build the rtInterface executables
	cd $FC_HOME/examples/rtInterface/src
	make clobber
	make install

This will place two executables in $FC_HOME/examples/bin
	$FC_HOME/examples/bin/rtStim
	$FC_HOME/examples/bin/showThis

It will also copy two shell scripts to $FC_HOME/examples/bin
	$FC_HOME/examples/bin/go
	$FC_HOME/examples/bin/go1

It will also place one RTLinux module in $FC_HOME/examples/modules
	$FC_HOME/examples/modules/rt_process.o

"rtStim" will be the process which sends messages to the "rt_process"
module.  These messages will be used to start and stop a period RT task.

"showThis" will be the process which receives messages from the "rt_process"
module.  These will consist of startup info plus a heartbeat message every
5 seconds.

===================================
How to run the rtInterface example
===================================
For this you will need to open 3 consoles (or Xterm windows).

on Console 1: logged into $FC_HOME/bin

	fclogger -n LOGGER   
	(or fclogger -n LOGGER > junk   to redirect trace log to a file)
	where
		LOGGER - name given to the trace logger process

on Console 2: logged into $FC_HOME/examples/bin

	go
(ctrl C will exit from this and do cleanup)

on console 3: logged into $FC_HOME/examples/bin

	go1

	A prompt for a command will appear:
		Enter command:
for a list of possible commands you can enter ?

To run this little example type each of the follow commands in sequence
and examine the output of the trace logger on console 1 BETWEEN each.

	Enter command: g
wait some time (at least 10 seconds) ... you can flip over to console 1
(where fclogger was run) to view the heartbeat message  

	Enter command: h
	Enter command: q

What we are doing is causing a START_STOP_TASK_MSG to be sent from 
"rtStim" -> "rt_process".  This message will then start a periodic rt task
to start running (see fun() in rt_process.c).  Every 5 seconds this periodic 
task will send a KICK_YOU_MSG from "rt_process" -> "showThis".   When 
"showThis" gets the message it logs to the trace logger.

Have fun.
