This was a test to see if we could get SIMPL to work with C++
code.  So what I did was copy the benchmark test and created a
Sender Class and a Receiver Class.

Sender.cpp - C++ code that uses the Sender Class
Sender.hpp - Sender Class and methods
Receiver.cpp - C++ code that uses the Receiver Class
Receiver.hpp - Receiver Class and methods
FCID.hpp - a copy of the FCID structure used in SIMPL 'C' code

You should be able to use the 3 .hpp files with your C++ code that
you wish to use SIMPL with.  If you think the C++ .hpp files need
improving, please by all means modify them, just let me know what
changes you make.  As mentioned, this was to test SIMPL with C++, but
also to help me learn more about C++.

To Run:
You will need 2 consoles...

1.) go to cpp/bin and run

Receiver -n BOBR

-n = SIMPL name of application

2.) go to cpp/bin and run

Sender -n BOBS -r BOBR -t 60000 -s 1024

If it works, it should inform you how long it took to send
60000 (-t) messages of 1024 (-s) bytes.

-t = how many times to send a message
-s = size in bytes of message
-n = SIMPL name of application
-r = SIMPL name of receiver

Side Note:

My Machine - P3-500 with 512Megs of RAM running Lycoris Linux Build 44

~4833ms to send 60000 messages of 1024 bytes...

The SIMPL benchmark code written in 'C' does the following on the same
machine:
