=======================================
How to build the tclet4 example.
=======================================
This makes the assumption that you have already downloaded and
installed the latest SIMPL code.  It also makes the assumption
that you have tcl8.0 or better installed on your machine. 

1) undo the SIMPL examples tarball at one directory ABOVE
$SIMPL_HOME. ie:
	cd $SIMPL_HOME
	cd ..
	tar -zxvf <tarballname>

2) build the tclet executables
	cd $SIMPL_HOME/examples/tclet4
	make clobber
	make install

This will place three files in $SIMPL_HOME/examples/bin
	$SIMPL_HOME/examples/bin/tclet4.html
	$SIMPL_HOME/examples/bin/tclet4.tcl
	$SIMPL_HOME/examples/bin/cbServer

"tclet4.tcl" is the applet code and tclet4.html is the web page which embeds the
applet.

===================================
How to run the tclet example
===================================
Note: an assumption is made that you have downloaded and installed
TclPlugin v2.0 or better.   The assumption is also made that you have
installed the fcsocket.tcl package in the TclPlugin directory as per
the 
	$SIMPL_HOME/tcl/src/readme

For this you will need to open 1 console (or Xterm windows).

on Console 1: logged into $SIMPL_HOME/examples/tclet4/src

	go

This will start up the trace logger (fclogger) and the tclSurrogate in the
background.  It will startup the call back agent (cbServer) in the foreground.
The cbServer will attempt to perform a name locate on the name assigned to
the tclet (BOBTCL).  At this point this will fail because the tclet is not yet
running.  The cbServer will pause waiting for user input to try the locate
again.

To bring up the tclet4.tcl use the browser to retrieve the tclet4.html file.
This should cause the tclet (tclet4.tcl) to render.   At this point the 
applet has been installed as a normal SIMPL enabled "receiver".

Go back to the console on which you ran the "go" script and hit any key
to enable the name locate to repeat.   This should allow the agent to find
the tclet and establish contact.

You then need to press the "make call back" button to force the call back
sequence to occur.   

What is going to happen is:
	i) the tclet will compose a message containing the current label
color and reply it back to the send blocked agent (cbServer)
	ii) the message will contain the name of the Tcl/Tk call back
function to call when the response is sent
	iii) the agent (cbServer) will take this reply and extract the color
	iv) the agent will generate a new color and compose a response 
message containing the call back function name and the new color info
	v) the agent will then send this message back to the tclet
	vi) when the tclet receives the response it will extract the new
color info and the call back function name and invoke the callback with
the new color info as an argument

If this sequence is successful the color of the text box should change to 
reflect the coding on the cbServer SIMPL process. 

Have fun.
