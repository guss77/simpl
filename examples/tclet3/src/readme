=======================================
How to build the tclet3 example.
=======================================
This makes the assumption that you have already downloaded and
installed the latest SIMPL code.  It also makes the assumption
that you have tcl8.0 or better installed on your machine.

1) undo the SIMPL examples tarball at one directory ABOVE
$SIMPL_HOME. ie:
	cd $SIMPL_HOME
	cd ..
	tar -zxvf <tarballname>

2) build the tclet executables
	cd $SIMPL_HOME/examples/tclet3
	make clobber
	make install

This will place three files in $SIMPL_HOME/examples/bin
	$SIMPL_HOME/examples/bin/tclet3.html
	$SIMPL_HOME/examples/bin/tclet3.tcl
	$SIMPL_HOME/examples/bin/rpcServer

"tclet3.tcl" is the applet code and tclet3.html is the web page which embeds the
applet.   rpcServer is the SIMPL application which handles the "remote" end of
the Remote Procedure Call.

===================================
How to run the tclet example
===================================
Note: an assumption is made that you have downloaded and installed
TclPlugin v2.0 or better.   The assumption is also made that you have
installed the fcsocket.tcl package in the TclPlugin directory as per
the 
	$SIMPL_HOME/tcl/src/readme

For this you will need to open a single console (or Xterm window).

on Console 1: logged into $SIMPL_HOME/examples/tclet3/src

	go

using the browser retrieve the tclet3.html file above.   This should cause the 
tclet (tclet3.tcl) to render.   At this point the applet has been installed
as a normal SIMPL enabled "sender".

You then need to press the "make RPC call" button to force the 
RPC call to occur.   

If this step is successful the color of the text box should change to 
reflect the coding on the rpcServer SIMPL process. 

Have fun.
