=======================================
How to build the tclcgi example.
=======================================
This makes the assumption that you have already downloaded and
installed the latest SIMPL code.  It also makes the assumption
that you have tcl8.0 or better installed on your machine.

1) undo the SIMPL examples tarball at one directory ABOVE
$SIMPL_HOME. ie:
	cd $SIMPL_HOME
	cd ..
	tar -zxvf <tarballname>

2) build the tclSender executables as this example makes use
of tclSim from this code set
	cd $SIMPL_HOME/examples/tclSender/src
	make clobber
	make install

3) build the tclcgi executables
	cd $SIMPL_HOME/examples/tcl_cgi/src
	make clobber
	make install

This will place two files into the bin directory
	$SIMPL_HOME/examples/tcl_cgi/bin/tclSender.tcl
	$SIMPL_HOME/examples/tcl_cgi/bin/tclcgi.html

These two files need to be moved to the corresponding Apache cgi-bin and
html directories respectively.

"tclSender.tcl" will be the be the CGI sender of messages to "tclSim".
These messages will demonstate Send/Receive/Reply messaging between a
Linux app and a Tcl CGI script.

===================================
How to run the tcl_cgi example
===================================
For this you will need to open 3 consoles (or Xterm windows).

on Console 1: logged into $SIMPL_HOME/examples/tcl_cgi/src
		gotest

on console 2: using Netscape browse the following URL
	http://localhost/tclcgi.html


The "tclSim" (Sim stands for simulator) should prompt for a command with:
	Enter command:
for a list of possible commands you can enter ?

To run this little example type a message into the form which appears on
console 2.   Hit <enter>.  This should cause your message to be transmitted
to the tclSim SIMPL receiver running on console #1.   You can respond to this
message by typing 
	r whateveryouwant
at the Enter command: prompt.

To end the session simply type "q" at the prompt on console 1.

What we are doing is causing a FC_TESTING_MSG to be sent from 
tclSender.tcl  -> tclSim.  This message will then be displayed 
on console 2 screen and placed in the trace log.

Have fun.

PS.
This simple example can form the basis of some very powerful CGI interfaces
to SIMPL receivers.
