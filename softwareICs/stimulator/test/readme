==============================================================
Stimulator SIMPL softwareIC.
==============================================================

There are 3 processes involved in this demo of the stimulator IC.
	receiver - the process which receives and processes messages
	stimulator - the process which stimulates the receiver
	recvTester - the process which illustrates automation of stimulator

======================================
How to run stimulator unit testing.
======================================
You will need two consoles logged onto

	$SIMPL_HOME/softwareICs/stimulator/test

for this test.

On console 1:
You will need to run the startup script:

	gostim

This will startup the following processes:
	fclogger - trace logger
	receiver
	stimulator

You can terminate this script with a <ctrl C> or by entering "q" at the
-> stimulator prompt.

At the -> stimulator prompt you can try entering the following 
-> ?   - this will display all the stimulator UI options
-> t hi - this will send this message to the receiver 
-> q - this will cause the stimulator to terminate gently

On console 2:
You will need to run the automation script:

	goauto

This will startup the following processes:
	recvTester
which will take its sequencing instructions from a data file called
	$SIMPL_HOME/softwareICs/data/test_001

NOTE:
The trace logger output is being routed to file
	$SIMPL_HOME/bin/junk
