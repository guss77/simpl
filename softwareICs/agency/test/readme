Agency SIMPL softwareIC.

There are 3 processes involved in this demo of the agency IC.
	agency - the main agency code including queue
	requestor - the process which sends to agency
	agent - the process which handles message

======================================
How to run agency unit testing.
======================================

You will need one console logged onto 

	$SIMPL_HOME/softwareICs/agency/test

for this test.

You will need to run the startup script:

	goagent

This will startup the following processes:
	fclogger - trace logger
	agency
	agent
	requestor

You can terminate this script with a <ctrl C> or by entering "q" at the
-> requestor prompt.

At the -> requestor prompt you can try entering the following 
-> ?   - this will display all the requestor UI options
-> t hi - this will send this message to the agency and on to the agent
-> q - this will cause the requestor to terminate gently

NOTE:
The goagent startup script has a built in delay of 10 secs assigned to the
agent process.  This will force any requestor messages within the first 10
seconds to exercise the queue logic in the agency.

NOTE2:
The trace logger output is being dumped into a file called
	$SIMPL_HOME/bin/junk
