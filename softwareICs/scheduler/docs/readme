Scheduler Software IC
______________________________________________________

To operate this scheduler softwareIC you'll need two
consoles.

On the first console you'll need to startup the main portion of
test s0005 by typing:

	dotest s0005
	-> d 30 hi
	-> w 45 hello
	-> s 55 bye
	->

On the second console you'll need to startup the auxillary portion of
test s0005 by typing:

	auxtest s0005
	-> s
	->

If all goes well you should see the list of scheduled messages which were
created with the d (DAILY),  w (WEEKLY) and s (SINGLE SHOT) commands on you
auxillary screen.

The scheduler is currently running on a 10 sec clock tick and once the 
message expires it will be transmitted to the agent process.  You'll have
to examine the trace log to see that the text of these messages is transmitted
correctly. The trace log can be found at:

	$TEST_HOME/tests0005/results/junk

As always if you notice bugs or make any improvements be sure to contact
us on the SIMPL project mailing list.
