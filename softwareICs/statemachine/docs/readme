Statemachine Software IC
==============================
Statemachine logic is a very common element of many software applications.

This code is divided into two sections which are remerged by the Makefile.

The SM_common contains the basic statemachine logic and framework.

The SM_door contains all the implementations of the statemachine API
and all logic associated with a simple door

The unit test is s0007 which operates this whole show.

This software IC has its own built in datastore which is fed from a
simple value: data paired text file.   The datastore itself uses the
concept of a preallocated memory pool which is more embedded friendly
than the full dynamic memory allocations.

The statemachine is operated upon by a single test stub called eventStim.

The eventStim test stub is wearing many hats in this demo. 

The eventStim can be used to operate the various datastore operations:

	ADD
	DELETE
	OVERWRITE
	RESYNC

The eventStim can be used to issue the events associated with a door:

	UNLOCK
	OPEN
	CLOSE
	TIMER

The eventStim is configured to receive any ALARM messages that the 
statemachine issues.    In the case of the door their is an alarm 
event associated with the door being held open beyond a specificed window.

The statemachine logic can accomodate many different doors in its datastore.

As always if you find bugs,  add enhancements or bug fixes we'd love to 
hear from you.   Just contact the SIMPL project mailing list.
