Polling Emitter Software IC
________________________________

To operate this emitter softwareIC you'll need three
consoles.

On the first console you'll need to startup the main portion of
test s0004 by typing:

	dotest s0004
	-> 

On the second console you'll need to open up the data file which 
is being polled in your favorite editor: 

	cd $TEST_HOME/tests0004/data
	vi bob.dat

On the third console you'll need to open up the and tail the trace
log file:

	cd $TEST_HOME/tests0004/results
	tail -f junk

If all goes well you should see the time stamp on the file being polled
every second.   

If you make changes to the second line in the data file on console #2
and commit those changes,  the emitter should pickup the data and emit it
to the queueSim process and you should see the string appear on your
first console.

The emitter isn't in constant communication with the queue so another 
shared memory mechanism is used to signal the emitter to "call home"

This is kicked by typing

	-> c hello
	->

at console 1

The emitter should call home and the string you typed after the "c" above
should be Reply()'d back to the emitter and displayed in the trace log.

As always if you notice bugs or make any improvements be sure to contact
us on the SIMPL project mailing list.
