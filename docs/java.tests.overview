======================================

This is a brief description of the SIMPL-java tests. A more detailed
description can be found in each test's directory in the file aptly called
"description".

Each particular test is containbed within its own directory such as testjs0001.
The naming convention is such that it is a test, it concerns some aspect of
java-simpl (js) and the test number is 0001 in this case.

Two java-simpl object types are available, viz. Jsimpl and Ssimpl.

Jsimpl is JNI (Java Native Interface) based code. This means that C language
functions underlie the Jsimpl object methods. Jsimpl would be the natural choice
for hosts that are NOT windows such as UNIX, QNX, Linux, Solaris, MAC OS X and
so on. Jsimpl stands alone for local SIMPL communications and works seamlessly
with the varous surogates available.

Ssimpl is written entirely in java. It is for use use with networks where some
of the hosts are windows based. For example, a windows host running a java
program which sends/receives messages from a Linux host running a
C/java/python/tcl etc. program. This requires the presence of the tclSurrogate
running on the Linux host in this particular case.


Tests js0001-js0003 test the packing/unpacking methods within Jsimpl.
Tests js0004-js0006 test the packing/unpacking methods within Ssimpl.
Tests js0007-js0010 test Jsimpl communication scenarios.
Tests js0001-js0018 test Ssimpl communication scenarios.

The tests are listed as follows:

js0001
======

Tests the packing/unpacking Jsimpl methods associated with
constructing/deconstructing a binary-type message. Binary type messages are
those that may have additional space padding within them for compatibility with
such things as C structures.

js0002
======

Tests the packing/unpacking Jsimpl methods associated with
constructing/deconstructing a character-type message. Character type messages
are those where the data items within the message are simply concatenated
together. An XML message would be of this sort.

js0003
======

Tests the packing/unpacking Jsimpl methods associated with
constructing/deconstructing an offset-type message. Offset type messages
are those where the put/get methods are overloaded with an offset integer. This
tells the pack/unpacker the put/get the relevant data item to/from that
particular offset from the start of the message. This is useful to a program
that is only interested in one or two items within a particular message.

js0004
======

Same as js0001 but for Ssimpl objects.

js0005
======

Same as js0002 but for Ssimpl objects.

js0006
======

Same as js0003 but for Ssimpl objects.


js0007
======

Tests binary messaging between a Jsimpl java receiver and a C sender.

js0008
======

Tests binary messaging between a Jsimpl java sender and a C receiver.

js0009
======

Tests character messaging between a Jsimpl java sender and a java receiver.

js0010
======

Tests offset messaging between a Jsimpl java sender and a java receiver.

js0011
======

Tests binary messaging between a Ssimpl java receiver and a C sender.

js0012
======

Tests binary messaging between a Ssimpl java receiver and a Jsimpl java sender.

js0013
======

Tests character messaging between a Ssimpl java receiver and a Jsimpl java
sender.

js0014
======

Tests offset messaging between a Ssimpl java receiver and a Jsimpl java sender.

js0015
======

Tests binary messaging between a Ssimpl java sender and a C receiver.

js0016
======

Tests binary messaging between a Ssimpl java sender and a Jsimpl java receiver.

js0017
======

Tests character messaging between a Ssimpl java sender and a Jsimpl java
receiver.

js0018
======

Tests offset messaging between a Ssimpl java sender and a Jsimpl java receiver.
