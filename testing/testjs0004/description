js0004: Java Ssimpl binary pack/unpack test

This test examines the veracity of the packing and unpacking methods with
respect to a binary memory arrangement such as that found in C structures which
often use some form of padding for the sake of memory boundaries. The
packing/unpacking methods cover all java primitive forms and one dimensional
arrays. These methods would be required for SIMPL communications with C programs
which use structures as message definitions.

These methods are contained in the class called Ssimpl.
