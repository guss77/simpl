js0015: Java Ssimpl java-sender/C-receiver binary message test

This test consists of a local Ssimpl java sender program exchanging a
binary-type message with a local C receiver program. The C sender is running
locally for convenience only. It is actually communciating with the java sender
via the tclSurrogate. The tclSurrogate allows the receiver to be running on
another host but for our purposes, the host setting is localhost, hence
communications occur via sockets through the loopback interface.
