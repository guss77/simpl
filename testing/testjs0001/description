js0001: Java Jsimpl binary pack/unpack test

This test examines the veracity of the packing and unpacking methods with
respect to a binary memory arrangement such as that found in C structures which
often use some form of padding for the sake of memory boundaries. The
packing/unpacking methods cover all java primitive forms and one dimensional
arrays. These methods might be required for SIMPL communications with C programs
which often use structures as message definitions.

These methods are contained in the JNI library which are defined in the class
called Jsimpl.
