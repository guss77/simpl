js0003: Java Jsimpl offset pack/unpack test

This test examines the veracity of the packing and unpacking methods with
respect to an offset placing in the message memory arrangement. Each variable
is read from/written to the desired offset within the message. This can be
useful for reading/writing only one or two data items within a message rather
than having to read/write all of the message elements when you are only
interested in some. The packing/unpacking methods cover all java primitive forms
and one dimensional arrays.

These methods are contained in the JNI library which are defined in the class
called Jsimpl.
