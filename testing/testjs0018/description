js0018: Ssimpl java-sender/Jsimpl java-receiver offset message test

This test consists of a local Ssimpl java sender program exchanging an
offset-type message with a local Jsimpl java receiver program. The java receiver
is running locally for convenience only. It is actually communciating with the
java sender via the tclSurrogate. The tclSurrogate allows the receiver to be
running on another host but for our purposes, the host setting is localhost,
hence communications occur via sockets through the loopback interface.
