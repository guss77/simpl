js0011: Java Ssimpl java-receiver/C-sender binary message test

This test consists of a local C sender program exchanging a binary-type message
with a local java receiver program. The C sender is running locally for
convenience only. It is actually communciating with the java receiver via the
tclSurrogate. The tclSurrogate allows the sender to be running on another host
but for our purposes, the host setting is localhost, hence communications
occur via sockets through the loopback interface.

The methods used in the java receiver program are contained in the class called
Ssimpl.
