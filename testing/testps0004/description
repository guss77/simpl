ps0004: class_S Python receiver/sender, offset mode tclSurrogate unit test

There are two SIMPL modules involved in this test:
	1. receiverw.py
	2. sender.py

The receiverw.py script would usually be run on a
Windows host. For our purposes, the host name is set
within the receiverw.py program to be localhost so
that the test can be run on a single Linux host.

The receiverw.py is run in the background and the
sender.py follows in the foreground.  The interaction
is done via the tclSurrogate protocol.
