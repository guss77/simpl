js0017: Ssimpl java-sender/Jsimpl java-receiver character message test

This test consists of a local Ssimpl java sender program exchanging a
character-type message with a local Jsimpl java receiver program. The java
receiver is running locally for convenience only. It is actually communciating
with the java sender via the tclSurrogate. The tclSurrogate allows the receiver
to be running on another host but for our purposes, the host setting is
localhost, hence communications occur via sockets through the loopback
interface.
