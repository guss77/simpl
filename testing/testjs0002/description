js0002: Java Jsimpl character pack/unpack test

This test examines the veracity of the packing and unpacking methods with
respect to a character memory arrangement. Such an arrangement is simply a
packing of each memory element in the first available memory position; ie.
concatenated without any form of padding. The packing/unpacking methods cover
all java primitive forms and one dimensional arrays.

These methods are contained in the JNI library which are defined in the class
called Jsimpl.
