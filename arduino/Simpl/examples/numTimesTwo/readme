--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This example is comprised of an ardunio board with ethernet shield connected to
the internet. The arduino sends a long integer (32-bit) to a receiver program
running on the icanprogram host. This SIMPL receiver then doubles the number
and replies the result back to the arduino. A copy of the SIMPL receiver
program which resides on the icanprogram host can be found in
./remoteReceiver/src.

Note that the number sent by the arduino is a long int because the arduino is a
32-bit device. The number in the receiver.c program is indicated merely as an
int because the icanprogram host where it resides is a 64-bit machine. Be
careful matching data items between different devices!

It is assumed that your host computer has the arduino and the SIMPL packages
installed and configured correctly. It is also assumed that your host has
internet connectivity.

*** You will have to copy the numTimesTwo.ino file into your sketchbook
directory.

1. Bring up the file numTimesTwo.ino in the arduino interface. Edit the line
defining the MAC address for the ethernet shield to the one on your chip. The
line of interest is around line 27.

2. Compile numTimesTwo.ino via the arduino interface.

3. Upload the image file to the arduino.

4. Open the serial monitor in order to observe feedback from the arduino.

5. If you see "Initialization is complete." then the arduino has successfully
SIMPL name attached on the icanprogram server. If not, there is a network issue
to be dealt with. It may take thirty seconds depending on the network: Be
patient.

What you should see via the serial monitor is:

sent "n"
received "2n"

in loop running numbers from 1-100 and getting back 2-200.

The message will come from numTimesTwo.ino, sent through the internet to the
tclSurrogate on the icanprogram host where the C SIMPL receiver program is
running. The receiver program will double the number and reply the result back
to the arduino via the tclSurrogate and the internet. The arduino will display
the result via the serial monitor.

The purpose of these little programs is to demonstrate how the arduino can SIMPL
message over a network as a SIMPL sender.
